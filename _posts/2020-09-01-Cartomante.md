<p>In <em>Cartomante</em>, we set out to create an authentic narrative of everyday life, Latin American at its roots and Brazilian at its core. The game is a modest homage to the urban folklore of Rio de Janeiro, presented through an experience of magical realism.</p>

<p>The game was developed over the course of three months, with every member of <b><a href="https://garoastudios.com">Garoa</a></b> contributing to the creative process.</p>

<p>I worked on the game's <b>narrative</b> â€” characters, story, dialogues, and narrative design â€” in both the English and Brazilian Portuguese versions. I also contributed to the game's <b>UI/UX</b> and <b>production</b>, organizing workload, managing deadlines, defining scope, and coordinating publication on Steam, itch.io, and Nuuvem.</p>

<p>I was responsible for most of the <b>social media upkeep</b> related to <em>Cartomante</em>, as well as its <b>PR</b> efforts â€” bringing the game to live events, conventions, and festivals, giving interviews, and participating in podcasts and other media appearances.</p>

<p><em>Cartomante</em> was a finalist for Best Brazilian Game at BIG Festival 2021, received an Honorable Mention for Best Narrative at SBGames 2020, and was officially selected for the 5th EcrÃ£ Festival and the Chainsaw Game & Music Festival 2021.</p>
